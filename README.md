# Hubble-Parameter-and-Age-of-Universe-Prediction

The accelerated expansion of the Universe is a cornerstone discovery in modern cosmology, and Type Ia supernovae serve as critical tools in probing this phenomenon. This project explores the Î›CDM cosmological model by analyzing data from the Pantheon+SH0ES compilation of Type Ia supernovae. By modeling the relationship between redshift and distance modulus, we fit theoretical predictions to observational data and estimate key cosmological parameters. The study employs non-linear least squares fitting, residual analysis, and parameter variation techniques to investigate the consistency of the model and explore potential redshift-dependent effects. Through this approach, we gain deeper insight into the dynamics of cosmic expansion and the age of the Universe.
